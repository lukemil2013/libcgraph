LibCGraph

    We are working on a shared library for graph representation and exploration
in C. The basic structures are already defined and I think they should work.
The interpretation of the resulting structures is left to the application developer.


Use:
    In order to create a graph the developer should first define the variables
that are going to be wrapped in the vertex structure and create the vertices by
referencing those variables in the data pointer. It is recommended to 
use the addVertex and addEdge functions to add newly created vertices and edges
to the graph. The edges need to be defined using references to the vertices in 
a graph's vertex array after they have all been added. 

The assumption we are making is that if each node is unique and defined in the 
array, we can compare the address of the vertices rather than the data wrapped 
in the vertex structure.
